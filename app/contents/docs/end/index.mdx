# Thank You & Project Endnote

Through *scalable chain-of-thought post-training* and *absolute zero self-play*, this work advances foundational capabilities in LLM reasoning, inference cost control, and robust out-of-distribution generalization—without reliance on curated human data.

**We thank all project contributors, testers, and early users for their curiosity, technical feedback, and open-source ethos.**

## Collaboration & Citation

- For bugs, issues, or to contribute: submit a pull request or open an issue on the official repository.
- To cite this implementation, see our Citations & Bibliography page.

## Final Words

The field of machine reasoning continues to move rapidly. We hope these frameworks, tools, and experimental results empower new research, more robust deployments, and collaborative open science. Stay tuned for future updates, expanded benchmarks, and further innovations in scalable, data-free reasoning.
