# Error Case Studies

A rigorous understanding of where and why scalable reasoning models fail is critical. Here, we present key error classes, case samples, and remedies from the original Elastic Reasoning [1] and Absolute Zero [2] implementations.

## I. Elastic Reasoning: Error Patterns

### 1. **Premature `<think>` Termination**
**Observation:**  
Model emits `</think>` before using full allotted “thinking” tokens—leaving `solution` phase with insufficient context for hard problems.  
**Remedy:**  
Budget-constrained RL training (GRPO) with stricter reward on *final answer* completion increases use of thinking budget only for hard problems; for easy tasks, short thinking is rewarded.

### 2. **Over-long Reasoning, Truncated Solutions**
**Symptom:**  
Naive length budgets cause solution segment truncation; answer is clipped or empty.  
**Remedy:**  
Use separate budgets, always force `</think>` if reasoning budget (\(t\)) is exhausted, guaranteeing a full solution segment (see Sec. 3.2.2 [1]).

### 3. **Budget Generalization Failures**
Budget pairs (t*,s*) seen at train time may not always transfer, especially on unseen domains.  
Empirically, ER generalizes to new (t, s) pairs, but extreme low-(t,s) can expose limitations (see Fig. 4 in [1]).  
**Remedy:**  
Train on a “reasonable” budget range, monitor token allocation histograms post-train.

## II. Absolute Zero: Error Patterns

### 1. **Proposal Failure or Invalidity**
Proposer offers non-deterministic, unsafe, or ill-formatted program as candidate triplet.
- **Remedy:**  
  Use strong program validators — syntax, deterministic outputs (run twice), and reject use of forbidden imports like `os`, `sys`.

### 2. **Reward Hacking and Unlearnable Tasks**
Proposer emits tasks that are always trivial or unsolvable (learnability reward = 0 or 1).  
- **Remedy:**  
  Only reward tasks for which the solver’s average reward is strictly between 0 and 1; buffer and curriculum components can drop non-contributing triplets (Eq. 4 in [2]).

### 3. **Mode-specific Failure**
- *Deduction:* Solver produces output string with wrong answer due to missing function knowledge.
- *Abduction:* Model fails to infer valid input, gets stuck in trial-and-error cycle.
- *Induction:* Overfits to test cases in prompt but fails on withheld OOD cases.
**Remedy:** Hold-out buffer, detailed input-output parity in validation code (Figures 10-12, [2]).

### 4. **Safety and “Uh-Oh” Moments**
Some large models (esp. Llama3.1-8B) occasionally produce inappropriate or ungrounded outputs (“uh-oh moments”, Sec. 4.2.5 in [2]).
- **Remedy:**  
  Manual review and future research into safety-aware reward shaping.

## III. Debugging Rhythms

- Log both *failure mode* and *buffer contents* during runs.
- Use eval scripts that explicitly check (type, value, formatting) for all outputs; plot error class distribution.
- Recovery: allow filling batches with valid old buffer entries if proposer/solver output is invalid.

<Note>
Most critical errors arise from the interface between program generation (proposer) and environment validation. RL + stricter verifiers is necessary for robust self-play loops.
