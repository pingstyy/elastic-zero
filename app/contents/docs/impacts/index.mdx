# Broader Impacts & Limitations

## Societal & Ethical Impact

- **Budget-aware reasoning**: Enables lower-cost, more sustainable model deployment (energy, resources).
- **Self-improving LLMs**: Reduces need for massive human-labeled datasets, democratizing state-of-the-art reasoning research.
- **Education & Access**: Adaptive, scalable models can reach under-served domains and communities.

## Potential Risks & Limitations

- **Failure at segmentation**: Elastic Reasoning’s split thinking/solution may not suit highly interleaved QA/dialogue or non-monolithic problem types.
- **Opaque failure**: Token budgeting may hide critical partial reasoning, harming interpretability.
- **Safety issues**: Self-play (AZR) can generate unanticipated or sensitive content (“uh-oh moments”), particularly with very large/capable LLMs.

## Limitations

- Domain focus: Math/code settings dominate current evaluation. Further work needed for scientific question answering, multimodal, retrieval, or high-stakes domains.
- Still requires substantial compute at >10B scale.
- Safety-aware curriculum, meta-learning signals, and real-world deployment protocols are open problems.

<Note title="Responsible Use">
Always inspect generated solutions and avoid deploying unconstrained self-play agents in production for high-stakes uses without oversight.
