Follow these steps to set up and run the project efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed. Clone the repository:
Preferably python=3.12

## ðŸ§± Installation

This repo supports **Poetry**, **uv**, or plain **pip**. Follow the steps below to get started.

### 1. Python & Virtual Environment

Ensure youâ€™re using **Python 3.10+**. Start by creating an isolated environment.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/repo-name.git
cd repo-name

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
````

---

### 2. Installing Dependencies

You can install using **Poetry**, **uv**, **pip**, or from `setup.py`.

#### Option A: Using Poetry

```bash
# If poetry is not installed
pip install poetry

# Install dependencies
poetry install
```

> âœ… **Note:** Poetry handles both dependencies and virtualenv management. If you use Poetry's built-in venv, skip manual `.venv` creation.

#### Option B: Using uv (fast pip-compatible installer)

```bash
pip install uv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Option C: Using pip (classic)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Option D: Using setup.py

```bash
pip install .
# or, for development mode
pip install -e .
```

---

### 3. Running the Project

Run the main entry point using one of the following:

#### With Poetry

```bash
poetry run python run.py
```

#### With uv (same as pip)

```bash
python run.py
```

#### Directly (if in .venv)

```bash
python run.py
```

<Note title="Troubleshooting">
```Python
  If you encounter installation errors, 
  ensure your Python version matches the required version (3.10+),
  and that your virtual environment is activated.
```
</Note>
