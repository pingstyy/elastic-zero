title: Getting Started
description: Step-by-step instructions and project documentation for Absolute Zero & Elastic Reasoning implementations.
---

Welcome! This documentation details the end-to-end workflow for implementations of two state-of-the-art reasoning ML frameworks: **Absolute Zero** and **Elastic Reasoning (Scalable CoT via Elastic Reasoning)**.

---

## üß† Project Motivation

Recent advances in reasoning-optimized LLMs (see *Absolute Zero*, *Elastic Reasoning*) set a new SOTA for budget-aware chain-of-thought and zero-data bootstrapped RLVR. This project reproduces, evaluates, and extends these paradigms for scalable and robust ML deployments.

---

## üîÅ Absolute Zero

### üìò Overview

Absolute Zero initiates from nothing but a seed model and develops task-agnostic buffers that evolve through *RL-driven curriculum construction*.

---

### üîÅ Algorithm (Pseudocode)

```python
for t in range(T):
    # PROPOSE phase
    for task_type in ["deduction", "abduction", "induction"]:
        refs = sample_K_from_buffer(task_type)
        proposal = model.propose(task_type, refs)
        if validate(proposal):
            buffer[task_type].append(proposal)
    
    # SOLVE phase
    for task in sample_batch_from_buffers(B):
        solution = model.solve(task)
        reward = compute_reward(solution, task)
        update_model_rl(reward, baseline="per task-role")
```

### üß† Key Differences (Absolute Zero vs. Traditional ‚ÄúZero Setting‚Äù)

| Property            | Zero Setting                    | **Absolute Zero**                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Data Dependency     | Curated QA pairs (no rationale) | **No data of any kind**                      |
| Learning Type       | Supervised prompt tuning        | **Reinforced self-play**                     |
| Curriculum Building | Static                          | **Emergent, from multi-role buffers**        |
| Roles Involved      | Answer-only                     | **Deduction, Abduction, Induction**          |
| Use Case            | Benchmark QA                    | **Generalized self-learned reasoning tasks** |

## üß† Elastic Reasoning

> *Elastic Reasoning: Efficient and Scalable CoT via Budget-Aware Prompt Construction*

---

### üîÅ Core Idea

Elastic Reasoning introduces dynamic reasoning templates that adapt to token budgets and model performance. By stretching or compressing prompt examples, it balances reasoning quality with efficiency.

---

### üìå Components

* **CoT Sampler**: Retrieves examples from a reasoning bank.
* **Budget-Aware Constructor**: Fills prompt up to the max budget with diverse roles (e.g., explanation, critique).
* **Dynamic Pruning**: Drops non-critical context as budgets shrink.

### üí° Comparison Table

| Feature        | Traditional CoT          | **Elastic Reasoning**             |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Prompt Length  | Fixed or greedy          | **Elastic, budget-aware**         |
| Role Diversity | Single task (e.g. solve) | **Multi-role: reflect, critique** |
| Scalability    | Poor for small budgets   | **Adaptable to any budget**       |
| Efficiency     | O(n) task construction   | **Optimized sampling & reuse**    |
