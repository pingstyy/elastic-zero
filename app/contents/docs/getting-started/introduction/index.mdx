description: Overview of the implementation of Absolute Zero and Scaling CoT via Elastic Reasoning
---

Welcome to the documentation for the implementation of two cutting-edge machine learning papers: Absolute Zero and Scaling Chain-of-Thought via Elastic Reasoning. This site provides a comprehensive guide to the project, covering research motivations, methodologies, implementations, experiments, and more.
This project reproduces and extends the paradigms from these papers for scalable, robust ML deployments in reasoning tasks. Absolute Zero introduces reinforced self-play reasoning without external data, while Elastic Reasoning enables length-controllable chain-of-thought inference.

<Note title="Project Goals"> 
The primary aim is to provide reproducible implementations that achieve state-of-the-art performance in zero-data settings, with extensions for practical use in constrained environments.
