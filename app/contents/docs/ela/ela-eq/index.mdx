# Key Equations in Elastic Reasoning

Elastic Reasoning modifies the RL pipeline and inference with these mathematical foundations:

## Separate Budgeting

Total output budget `c` is allocated as `t` for thinking and `s` for solution, so:

```
c = t + s
```

At inference:
- The model generates up to `t` tokens in the `<think>` phase.
  - If it hasn't emitted `</think>`, forcibly insert the token.
- Then the model continues with the solution segment, up to `s` tokens.

The full output is:

```
y = (y\_think, y\_solution)

```

with the constraints:

```

len(y\_think) <= t
len(y\_solution) <= s

```

## RL Training Objective (Budget-Constrained Rollout)

Expected reward under fixed budget rollout:

```

J(θ) = E\_{x, y \~ π\_θ(y | x; t\*, s\*)} \[ r(y) ]

```

### Gradient (via GRPO):

```

∇*θ J(θ) = E*{x, y} \[ A(x, y) ∇\_θ log π\_θ(y | x; t\*, s\*) ]

```

### Advantage Baseline:

```

A(x, y) = r(y) - E\_{y' \~ π\_θ(y' | x; t\*, s\*)} \[ r(y') ]

````

This formulation reduces variance during training by normalizing the reward against the expected return under current policy and fixed budgets.

## Pseudocode: Budgeted Generation

```python
def elastic_reason(model, input, t, s):
    tokens = []

    # Thinking phase
    for i in range(t):
        tok = model.next_token(input + tokens)
        tokens.append(tok)
        if tok == '</think>':
            break
    else:
        tokens.append('</think>')

    # Solution phase
    for j in range(s):
        tok = model.next_token(input + tokens)
        tokens.append(tok)
        # Optionally, allow early stopping
        # if tok == '</sol>':
        #     break

    return tokens
````

See also Eq (1) and (2) in the Elastic Reasoning paper [1] for derivation of policy gradients with budget-aware rollouts.
