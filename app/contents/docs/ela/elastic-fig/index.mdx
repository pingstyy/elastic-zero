## Key Table

| Model             | AIME24 | AMC  | Olympiad | MATH | Minerva |
|------------------|--------|------|----------|------|---------|
| S1 (budget force) | 24.2   | 60   | 40       | 79.9 | 22      |
| L1 Max            | 27.1   | 70   | 41       | 83.6 | 28      |
| **E1-Math-1.5B**  | **35** | 67.7 | 43.6     | 83.6 | 30      |

## Observations

- Dedicating solution tokens ensures robust answer accuracy under budget constraints.
- The trained model is significantly more concise — even under no test constraint.
